# Challenge 1 - Building a Nest

# Goal
Create a system that will continuously measure (0.5 Hz) temperature in five locations in the room, compute the instantaneous average temperature and report these values to a central station in calibrated engineering units.

# Required Elements

- [X] Measures temperature at each device
- [ ] Sends data to base 
- [ ] Computes average
- [ ] Different program at base vs at wireless device
- [ ] Engineering units displayed

# Qualitative Elements

- [ ] Bonus features
- [ ] Evidence of scalability to 1000s of devices
- [ ] Robustness to added or dropped devices
-[ ] Demonstrated effort to calibrate sensors
